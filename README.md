# Perfect-Pitch

I was told, I cannot scientifically obtain a perfect-pitch anymore. A perfect-pitch is called, when you're able to memory tones and identify them by hearing without any reference tone.


That's why I decided to test myself and created this repository.

## Usage
Install the dependencies by running
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

and start the training by

```python start_training.py```


Enjoy :)
